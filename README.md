# CoffeeMachineSimulator
The project simulates the operation of a coffee machine in an interactive and user-friendly manner. It highlights the application of design patterns, SOLID principles, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to ensure a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable solution. 
NOTE : Entire project is made using C++, Visual Studio 2017.

The project tries to simulate the behaviour of the below coffee Machine:
